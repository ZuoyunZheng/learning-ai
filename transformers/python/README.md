## Transformers Python examples

### Python virtual environment
```console
$ source pytorch/bin/activate
```

### Prerequisites
Some of the example use IPython.core.display.HTML to show graphs and tables
which require a web browser and using Jupyter Notbook seems to be the easiest
way to enables this.
Install jupyter:
```console
(pytorch) $ pip install jupyter
```

### Starting Jupyter notebook
Start a notbook in the current directory:
```console
(pytorch) $ jupyter notebook
```
This will open up a directory listing in a web browser. 

To create a new notebook, there is a `New` button on the right hand side and
it will allow you to specify the `Python3` kernel. Using that will open and
unnamed file which we can then rename.
