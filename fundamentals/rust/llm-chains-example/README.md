## llm-chains Example

### Running
This example requires a OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to be set as
an environment variable:
```console
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

Then the example can be run using:
```console
$ cargo r

Assistant: Positional encoding is a technique used in the field of natural language processing (NLP) to represent the positional information of words or tokens in a sentence or document. The purpose of positional encoding is to provide the model with information about the order and relative distance between words in a sequence.

In NLP tasks, such as machine translation or text classification, it is important to consider the order of words in a sentence to understand the meaning or context. However, traditional neural network models, such as the ones based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), lack a built-in mechanism for directly handling positional information.

Positional encoding solves this problem by adding a set of fixed vectors to the input embeddings of words in a sequence. These vectors encode the relative positions of the words in the sequence. The positional encoding vectors are typically defined with a sine and cosine function of different frequencies and have the same dimensionality as the input embeddings.

The positional encoding vectors are added element-wise to the corresponding input embeddings, effectively providing the model with information about where each word is located in the sequence. By incorporating the positional information, the model can differentiate between words with the same embedding but in different positions.

The advantage of using positional encoding is that it enables models like the Transformer, which is a popular architecture for tasks like machine translation or language generation, to handle long-range dependencies between words in a sequence. The positional encoding allows the model to capture positional information without relying solely on the order of words in the input.

Overall, positional encoding is a technique that enriches the input embeddings of words or tokens with additional information about their positions in a sequence, enabling models to better handle the order and distance between words.
