## Radeon Open Compute Platform (ROCm)
Is an open-source software foundation for GPU computing.
It supports various programming languages and models, with notable support for
HIP (Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability), which allows developers
to write code in a single source file that can run on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs
with minimal changes.
