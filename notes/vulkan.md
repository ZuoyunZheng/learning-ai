## Vulkan API for graphics and compute
Is an opensource project that is led by the Khronos Group. The Vulkan API is a
low-level graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform
access to modern GPUs used in a wide variety of devices from PCs and consoles to
mobile phones and embedded platforms. 

There are proprietary alternatives like Nvidia's CUDA and Apple's Metal. Vulkan
is cross-platform and cross-vendor.

Kompute is general purpose GPU computing framework built upon Vulkan.

It is simlar to DirectX 12 or Metal. It can be used for low resource
environments such as mobile phones.
