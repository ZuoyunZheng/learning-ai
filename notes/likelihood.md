## Probability
Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It tells
you how likely something is to happen.

Example:
Imagine you have a fair six-sided die. The probability of rolling a 3 is 
1/6 or approximately 0.167. This means out of 6 possible outcomes, 1 of them isa 3.

## Likelihood
While probability tells us how likely an outcome is given a fixed model (or set
of parameters), likelihood tells us how well our model explains observed
outcomes. It's a measure of how good our model is, given some data.

Example:
Imagine you've rolled a die 10 times and got eight 3s. If you believe the die is
fair, the likelihood of observing these results is very low. However, if you
think the die might be biased towards 3, then the likelihood of observing these
results under this biased model is higher.

In this example:

Probability would be used to say "Given a fair die, what's the chance of rolling
a 3?"  
Likelihood would be used to say "Given that we rolled eight 3s out of 10 tries,
how likely is our model of a fair die versus a biased die?"

Probability is about the outcomes given a fixed model or parameters.
Likelihood is about evaluating different models or parameters given observed outcomes.
