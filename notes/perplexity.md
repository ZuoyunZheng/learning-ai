## Perplexity AI
This is a [service](https://www.perplexity.ai) that allows web search to be
integrated with an LLM.

This is pretty interesting as it provides the LLM with a way to access updated
information (information that is was not trained on), and use it to generate
responses, but it will `only` use the information that it has gathered and 
provides references to the sources. So it does not make things up (hallucinate).
