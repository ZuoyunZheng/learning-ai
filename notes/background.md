## AI/ML background


### Learning
Tranditionally programming would specify rules in functions and data would be
the input. And the output the computation of the rules on the data.

With machine learning we provide answers and data to the function and the output
are the rules. So we take data and then we label the data points, that is we
specify what they are. For example, lets say that we want to recoginize human
emotions by looking at photos of faces (expressions). We would train a model
by passing it images faces that are each tagged/labeled with a specific emotion,
like happy, sad, angry, etc. Notice that we this data must have been classified
by someone/something to add those tags/lables. So our model is something that
has been trained to recoginize facial expressions.
