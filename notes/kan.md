## Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)
Is bascially a suggestion to replace the multipli layer percpetron (MLP) in
neural networks. In MPL we have weights that are learnable and non-linear
functions in the neurons which are fixed (they can be different functions but
they are not changed during training, they are not learnable only the weights
are). In KAN there are no weights, instead they are replaced with univariant
functions (functions with one independent variable) that are learnable.

So what is the advantage of KAN over MLP?  
They can outperform MLP in terms of accuracy and interperprability
(understanding what is happening in the network is my understanding of this).
