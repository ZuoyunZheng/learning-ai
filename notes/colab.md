## Colab 

### Keyboard shortcuts
I needed to disable my vimium extension to get the keyboard shortcuts to work.
This can be done by adding a short cut for the extension in
chrome://extensions and then choose shortcuts from the menu. Then press the
edit button next to the extension and enter CTRL+SHIFT+V as the shortcut.
Now we can disable the extension by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+V, followed by
CTRL+ENTER.

With that done we can then use the short cuts in colab:
```
Command mode:       ESC
Edit mode:          ENTER
Up:                 k
Down:               j
Insert cell above:  a
Insert cell below:  b
Execute cell:       CTRL+ENTER
```
So view all short cuts press CTRL+M H.
