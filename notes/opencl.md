### Open Computing Language (OpenCL)
It is a framework for writing programs that execute across heterogeneous
platforms consisting of central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing
units (GPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), field-programmable gate arrays
 (FPGAs), and other processors or hardware accelerators. 

```console
$ sudo apt-get install opencl-headers ocl-icd-opencl-dev
