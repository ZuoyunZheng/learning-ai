## Hetrogenous-computing Interface for Portable (HIP)
Is a C++ runtime API and kernel language that allows developers to create
portable applications for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs from single source code. HIP gives
developers the ability to reuse CUDA code on AMD GPUs, and to write new code
that can run on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.

HIP is a C++ dialect that is designed to be familiar to CUDA developers.
