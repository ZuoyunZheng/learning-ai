## Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
Keep in mind that CPU's also have vector hardware like MMX, SIMD, and SSE, but
these are less powerful than GPU's. GPU's are designed to do many calculations
in parallel, which is why they are so good at matrix multiplication. Moving
memory is also an important aspect of GPU's, so they have a lot of memory
bandwidth. GPU's are also designed to be very power efficient, so they are
designed to do a lot of work with a small amount of power.
