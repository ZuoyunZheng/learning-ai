### Importance matrix

An importance matrix (imatrix) is a technique used to improve the quality of quantized models in machine learning. It helps determine the importance of different model activations during the quantization process, which is the process of reducing the precision of the model's weights to use less memory.
How it Works
The imatrix is calculated based on calibration data, which is a representative dataset used to analyze the model's behavior. The idea behind the imatrix is to preserve the most important information during quantization, which can help reduce the loss of model performance.
Specifically, the imatrix uses the diagonal elements of the activation expectation value (the expected value of the product of an activation and itself) to determine the importance of each activation. The more important activations are given higher precision during quantization, while less important activations are quantized more aggressively to save memory.
