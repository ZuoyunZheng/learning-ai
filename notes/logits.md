## Logits
logits are the raw unnormalized predictions that a classification model
generates, before applying the activation function.

So these are the values before they are squashed through a function that makes
them probabilities (so there sum can be more than 1).

In deep learning, particularly in multi-class classification, the term "logits"
has been generalized to refer to the vector of raw scores output by the model
before applying the softmax function.
