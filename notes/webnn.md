## Web Neural Network API
Defines a hardware agnostic for ML capabilities in the browser. To be run
efficiently LLM inference need to be run on hardware accelerators, or at least
take advantage of CPU instructions. This API is designed so that browsers can
take advantage of hardware accelerators on the underlying platforms.
