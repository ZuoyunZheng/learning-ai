## Diffusion Models
Training in such a model is done by adding noise to an image, a little at a time
in small increments. This is called the forward diffusion process.

Then we have the reverse which removes noise from an image, which is called
the reverse diffusion process.

### Guassian noise
Named after Carl Friedrich Gauss this is a type of noise that is generated by
adding random values that are normally distributed, that is they have a mean of
0 and a standard deviation.

### Standard Deviation
The forumla looks like this:
```
SD = √( ∑|x - μ|² )         
       ---------
          N
x = a value in the data set
N = number of data points in the population
μ = mean of the data set
```
So we subtracting each data point, x, with the mean, and squaring it (possibly
to avoid negative numbers), and then summing all of them together. Then we
divide that by the total number of data points and then square root that.

Lets take the following set:
```
{6, 2, 3, 1}
```
First we find the mean:
```
μ = (6 + 2 + 3 + 1) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3
```
And then:
```
 |6 - 3|² = 3²  = 9
 |2 - 3|² = -1² = 1 
 |3 - 3|² = 0²  = 0
 |1 - 3|² = -2² = 4

 9 + 1 + 0 + 4 = 14

     14/4 = 3.5

√3.5 = 1.870828693
√3.5 ~ 1.870
```
The symbol for standard deviation is σ (sigma).
