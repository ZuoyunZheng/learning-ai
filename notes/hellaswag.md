## Harder Encodings, Larger contexts, and Low shot Activities for Situations With Adversary Generation (HellaSwag)
This is a benchmark about common sense resoning of/in LLMs. The dataset
tests commonsense natural language inference about physical situations.

I came accross this in llama.cpp in examples/perplexity and just wanted to
know what it was about. I might add more details in the future.
